            think you are coming in here alone. You think to yourself that
            it is only you that you will not find yourself.
            You're really wrong. There are others here too.
            You make one team. You get here
            support from coaches. Like in soccer or
            other sport. They will guide you as
            team to victory. Remember only one thing -
            it is your DECISION.
